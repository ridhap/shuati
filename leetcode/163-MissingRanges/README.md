## Solution explanation

The trick is to use `pre`, which is initialized as `lower - 1` and have `upper+1` append to the end
of the `nums`. For example, `lower = 0` and `upper = 99`. Then, use `pre` with `lower - 1` handles
the case `„Äê1, ...]` where `0` is missing. Similarly, `upper+1` appending to the end of the list
handles the case `...,98,100]` where `99` is missing. This problem doesn't really have nice structure
way to solve other than pattern discovery.
