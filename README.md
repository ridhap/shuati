This is the respository that put my [systematic algorithm learning](https://github.com/xxks-kkk/algo)
into practice by solving various interview kind of questions.

## Meta

Unlike other similar repos, this repo will use the language that I feel most comfortable for the question I
try to solve. I want to solely focus on the essence behind each question without constraint of choosing
which language to implement.
