## Solution Explanation

If the problem does not require to use the constant space, then our solution
can be the following, which is similar how we reverse the linked list:

```python
def swapPairs(self, head):
    """
    :type head: ListNode
    :rtype: ListNode
    """
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    n = head.next
    head.next = self.swapPairs(head.next.next)
    n.next = head
    return n
```

In this solution, we use $O(n)$ space on stack. For a list `1->2->3->4`, we
have `head` equals to `1` and `n` equals to `2`. Then, the solution is 
straightforward to understand.

To meet the problem requirement, we use the solution in .py:

Here, `pre` is the previous node. Since the head doesnâ€™t have a previous node, 
I just use `self` instead. Again, `a` is the current node and `b` is the next node.

To go from `pre -> a -> b -> b.next` to `pre -> b -> a -> b.next`, we need to 
change those three references. Instead of thinking about in what order I change them, 
I just change all three at once.
