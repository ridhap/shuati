 * [Problem Description]
 *          
 * 
 * Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both
 * should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number
 * should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be
 * no "holes" between ranks.
 * 
 * +----+-------+
 * | Id | Score |
 * +----+-------+
 * | 1  | 3.50  |
 * | 2  | 3.65  |
 * | 3  | 4.00  |
 * | 4  | 3.85  |
 * | 5  | 4.00  |
 * | 6  | 3.65  |
 * +----+-------+
 * For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the
 * following report (order by highest score):
 * 
 * +-------+------+
 * | Score | Rank |
 * +-------+------+
 * | 4.00  | 1    |
 * | 4.00  | 1    |
 * | 3.85  | 2    |
 * |Â 3.65  | 3    |
 * | 3.65  | 3    |
 * | 3.50  | 4    |
 * +-------+------+
