# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent,
# with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
#
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
#
# Note:
# You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
#
# click to show follow up.
#
# Follow up:
# A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
# First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
#
# Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
