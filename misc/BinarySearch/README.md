## Ways to write binary search

"binarySearch.py" contains two implementations that can work for the basic binary search problem:

given an integer $X$ and integers $A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{N-1}$, which are presorted in ascending order, find
$i$ such that $A_i = X$, or return $i = -1$ if $X$ is not in the input. There might be multiple of $i$ with $A_i = X$.

"binarySearch-2.py" contains commonly-seen variations of the binary search. To better understand the
binary search, I would suggest to read [my post](http://zhu45.org/posts/2018/Jan/12/how-to-write-binary-search-correctly/).
