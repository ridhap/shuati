## Solution explanation

Problem $O(n\log n)$ running time requirement naturally leads to the merge sort (We don't want to use quick sort :)).
Two important techniques used in linked list appear in this problem:

- Use two pointers approach to find the middle point of the linked list (see "143" README)
- Merge two sorted linked list into one (see "21")

The solution structure looks similar to "143".
